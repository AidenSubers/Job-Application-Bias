With machine learning algorithms implemented in job applicant screening processes, a biased group of applicants remain. Our goal is to detect potential biases using the current algorithm in the chosen job placement dataset (found on Kaggle), and then implement a new algorithm concentrated on eliminating bias between applicants.
